# EDA
1. 'A' stands for Andreas

# Feature management
1. Check join of train.csv with train_labels
2. Unlist event_data
3. Check for features in spec.csv file
4. Check features from other types in train.csv (e.g. Accumulated time or count per type)
5. Feature on dates, eg Monday , TUESDAY etc...

# Model management
1. Think of models to predict ordinal integer Response or just cool classifiers, ask friends or do some research   
2. We can also use the accuracy column in train_labels... which is a float   
(i.e.   accuracy = success/attempts  per game_session,    
so accuracy Îµ {0,1}   
where if 1 accuracy_group = 3,    
else if 0.5 accuracy_group = 2,    
else if < 0.5 accuracy_group = 1,    
else if 0 accuracy_group = 0 )    

3. Check probability as feature, # of failures to 1st success ~ G(p) (theoretically)
so in such case we need to estimate p , so we need to check if can apply this per <strong>installation_id</strong>,      
The following R package provides a fuction whcih given the number of failures till first success gives the p estimate of the geometric....https://rdrr.io/cran/EnvStats/man/egeom.html
